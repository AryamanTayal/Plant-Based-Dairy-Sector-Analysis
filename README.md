This project analyzes data from the plant-based dairy sector in India, covering key details on brands, the types of animal product alternatives they offer, pricing structures, and their distinct product lines. The objective is to understand the current market landscape and highlight notable patterns within the sector.

## Key Insights

- **Price differences:** Comparison of pricing across brands and product categories.  
- **Popular categories:** Identification of the most widely available and purchased plant-based dairy products.

## Data Structure and Initial Checks

The dataset consists of a single table, with the following columns:

- Product Name  
- Brands  
- Sector  
- Animal product replicated  
- Product Format  
- Price (INR)  
- Weight (Gms for meat and eggs, mL for dairy)  
- Price Per kg/L  
- Claims  
- Shelf life  
- Storage Conditions  
- Consumption Format  
- Ingredient list  
- Manufactured by  
- Length of ingredient list  
- Distributed and Marketed by  
- Packaged by  
- Marketed by  
- Type of Manufacturing  
- Distribution channels

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
The dataset includes over 170 product offerings from all brands combined, representing a comprehensive view of the plant-based dairy sector in India. These products span multiple animal product alternatives, including milk, paneer, curd, and cheese. 
Milk emerges as the most popular product, while there are notable price differences in certain categories, particularly butter. The data also indicates that most brands focus on a few star products, as nine brands have more than two offerings in their portfolio.

## Insights Deep Dive
### Most Common Product


-Milk is by far the most popular plant-based product in the dataset, accounting for nearly half of all offerings (43.7%). This dominance reflects a clear strategy by brands to first replace the most widely consumed dairy staple in India with a plant-based alternative.  

-Milk serves as the entry point for consumers transitioning to plant-based diets, making it the most commercially viable product for companies to prioritize. 
-Strong focus on milk suggests that the sector is building its foundation on the product with the highest everyday relevance and consumer acceptance.

### Distinct Product Offerings

- Only nine brands in the dataset offer two or more distinct products, indicating that most companies are concentrating their efforts on perfecting a single flagship item before expanding their range.
- Many brands are still in the early stages of development, choosing to establish a strong identity and consumer base around one core product before diversifying into additional plant-based dairy alternatives.

### Pricing Insights

The pricing analysis reveals significant differences across plant-based dairy product categories.  

- **Wide price range for cheese and butter:** Cheese shows the largest gap between minimum and maximum prices, with some premium brands pricing their products far higher than competitors. Butter also exhibits a notable spread, reflecting differing brand strategies and ingredient choices.  
- **Milk remains relatively consistent:** Plant-based milk has one of the narrowest price ranges, suggesting a more standardized market with less variation across brands.  
- **Premium positioning for certain products:** Ice cream and paneer have moderate to high price ranges, but average prices indicate that many brands are aiming for mid- to high-end consumers in these categories.  
- **High variability in butter pricing:** The data highlights that butter, in particular, shows the greatest inconsistency in price per kg/L, pointing to a lack of pricing benchmarks and different approaches to formulation and marketing.

These findings suggest that while some categories, like milk, are stabilizing with competitive pricing, others — notably cheese and butter — remain niche, premium-oriented offerings with significant pricing diversity.

## Recommendations

- **Diversify product portfolios:** Most brands currently focus on a single flagship product, often plant-based milk. Expanding into other categories like yogurt, paneer, or butter could help capture a wider consumer base.  

- **Address pricing gaps in premium categories:** Products such as cheese and butter show large price variations. Establishing more consistent pricing or offering tiered product ranges could improve accessibility.  

- **Focus on consumer education:** Since milk is the most common product, brands could use it as a gateway to introduce customers to other plant-based options through bundled offerings, recipes, or awareness campaigns.
