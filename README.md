### Overview of Findings
The dataset includes over 170 product offerings from all brands combined, representing a comprehensive view of the plant-based dairy sector in India. These products span multiple animal product alternatives, including milk, paneer, curd, and cheese. 
Milk emerges as the most popular product, while there are notable price differences in certain categories, particularly butter. The data also indicates that most brands focus on a few star products, as fewer than five brands have more than two offerings in their portfolio.

## Insights Deep Dive
### Most Common Product


-Milk is by far the most popular plant-based product in the dataset, accounting for nearly half of all offerings (43.7%). This dominance reflects a clear strategy by brands to first replace the most widely consumed dairy staple in India with a plant-based alternative.  

-Milk serves as the entry point for consumers transitioning to plant-based diets, making it the most commercially viable product for companies to prioritize. 
-Strong focus on milk suggests that the sector is building its foundation on the product with the highest everyday relevance and consumer acceptance.

### Distinct Product Offerings

- Only nine brands in the dataset offer two or more distinct products, indicating that most companies are concentrating their efforts on perfecting a single flagship item before expanding their range.
- Many brands are still in the early stages of development, choosing to establish a strong identity and consumer base around one core product before diversifying into additional plant-based dairy alternatives.
